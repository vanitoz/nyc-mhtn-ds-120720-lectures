    "### 𝜇 - \n",
    "the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### 𝜎 - \n",
    "the population standard deviation. The difference between population std. dev. and sample std. dev. is denoted as a \"s\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for explicit phrasing about what exactly is the whole (population). If there is no whole sample to draw from, it is a sample population. \n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### population - \n",
    "the collection of all the items of interest in a study (omega) the whole universe of things we are talking about\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### sample -  \n",
    "a subset of the population \n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### subset - \n",
    "all the items that are in the population but in a specific group. A proper subset is some of the elements but not all of them\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### p-value - \n",
    "The probability of getting a result at least as extreme as the sample  assuming the null hypothesis is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you null hypothesis is true what are the chance this (or something at least this extreme) even occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine your null hypothesis 𝐻0 is that the population mean 𝜇 is 𝜇=10. Upon drawing\n",
    "a sample, you get a mean of 12. With the p-value, you are going to obtain a probability that,\n",
    "given a null hypothesis of 𝜇=10, you would observe a sample mean of 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your p-value is low, you will reject your null hypothesis. \n",
    "You will basically say that based on current evidence and testing, \n",

    "If your p-value is high, you will fail to reject your null hypothesis. \n",
    "You will fail to reject the null hypothesis, \n",

    "the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.\n",

    "### Significance Threshold (alpha, 𝛼) - \n",
    "\n",
    "You noticed that we talked about \"high\" and \"low\" p-values, but that is pretty vague. \n",
    "What number is high and what number is low?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the significance level, also denoted as alpha or 𝛼 comes in. \n",
    "𝛼 is the threshold value that defines whether a p-value is low or high. \n",
    "You can define your alpha level yourself, but you'll see that an alpha level of \n",
    "𝛼=0.05 is most commonly used. You'll see 𝛼=0.1 and 𝛼=0.01 appear frequently as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "What level of alpha to use depends on your situation. Choosing a lower alpha leads to a test\n",
    "that is more strict, so you will be less likely to be able to reject your null-hypothesis \n",
    "(which is generally what you want). Choosing a higher alpha or significance level leads to \n",
    "a higher probability of rejecting the null-hypothesis. The downside of using a higher alpha\n",
    "level, however, is that you run a higher risk of falsely concluding that there is a difference\n",
    "between your null-hypothesis and your observed results when there actually isn't any.\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value > alpha --> we fail to reject Null Hypothesis\n",

    "\n",
    "### T-Critical -\n",
    "\n",
    "For one samples. Right tailed. If your t-value is greater than your t-crit you will reject your null hypothesis and if it is less than your t-crit you will fail to reject your null hypothesis.\n",
    "Because it is right tailed only the first 2 of the examples apply.\n",
    "If left tailed the last 2 of the examples apply. \n",
    "Remember that if single tailed, the alpha will not be divided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically for a 2 sided test, remember to divide alpha by 2, with each half in both tails. When our test statistic value, (z or t score) greater or less than t-critical value we can reject \n",
    "\n",
    "if t-value > t-critical --> we reject Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "if t-value < t-critical --> we fail to reject Null Hypothesis\n",

    "### Linear Regression - \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical methodology that estimates the strength between two or more\n",
    "variables. The regression results show if the relationship is valid or not.\n",

    "Regression Analysis is a parametric technique meaning a set of parameters are used to predict the value of an unknown target variable (or dependent variable)  based on one or more of known input features (or independent variables, predictors), often denoted by \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, regression analysis helps us in the following ways:\n",

    "* Identifying which variables contribute more towards the outcomes\n",
    "* Prediction of future observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression - uses a single feature (one independent variable) to model a linear relationship with a target (the dependent variable) by fitting an optimal model\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Slope and Intercept are the coefficients or the parameters of a linear regression model.\n",
